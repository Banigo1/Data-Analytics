- Plotly Graph Objects is the low-level interface to figures, traces, and layout whereas plotly express is a high-level wrapper for Plotly. 

- Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications. It is both enterprise-ready and a first-class member of Plotlyâ€™s open-source tools. 

- Core and HTML are the two components of dash. 

- The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag. 

- The dash_core_components describe higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library. 

- A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes. Callback function is decorated with `@app.callback` decorator. 

- Callback decorator function takes two parameters: Input and Output. Input and Output to the callback function will have component id and component property. Multiple inputs or outputs should be enclosed inside either a list or tuple.
